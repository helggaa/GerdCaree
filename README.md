GerdCare

GerdCare is an Android application developed to raise awareness of Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) in Indonesia and prevent serious complications. Our goal is to provide features that not only help prevent GERD but also assist users in managing the condition effectively, ultimately improving their quality of life.

Features
1. My Condition
The "My Condition" feature provides personalized recommendations for users based on their current health status. It helps users plan their activities for the next day to prevent the recurrence of GERD symptoms.

2. Medication Reminder
To ensure users adhere to their prescribed medication schedule, the "Medication Reminder" feature sends timely reminders. Users can stay on track with their medication plan and be informed about the remaining medications as per their doctor's recommendations.

3. Meal Reminder
Maintaining a balanced diet is crucial in managing GERD symptoms. The "Meal Reminder" feature prompts users to follow their regular eating schedule, helping reduce the impact of GERD symptoms.

4. Ambulance Service
In emergency situations, the "Ambulance Service" feature allows users to quickly call for an ambulance or find the nearest emergency contact. This ensures prompt assistance when needed.
